# get the object detection working in depth Ai, use it to calculate the x, y, z of the ball.
# When the realsense can't detect the ball we need the x, y, z of the ball from DAI to get the ball's x, y w.r.t robot. 

# maintain detected balls to robot map

# Adding IMU readings for PI control - use both realsense and the depth Ai camera
# State estimation 

# to run 
# python3 example/tag.py |& tee log.txt

# Need to use filters to make sure that the object size between consecutive frames are preserved, or not change drastically. 

# Use realsense camera for object detection and tracking and the depth ai camera for april tags

# Send the robot data for visualization on the host

# When you see multiple ball track the one that is the target(to be caught)
# Hack is to use the ball that has the shortest distance

# issue: when the ball is closer to the robot in the claw 
 the x,y,z becomes noisy. i.e X is usually correct, Y and z are incorrect.  Current idea is to filter out all the ball who are not on ground. i.e if height of ball is > MAX_HEIGHT then ignore the ball.
