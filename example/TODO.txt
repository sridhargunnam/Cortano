# Need to use filters to make sure that the object size between consecutive frames are preserved, or not change drastically. 

# Use realsense camera for object detection and tracking and the depth ai camera for april tags

# Send the robot data for visualization on the host

# When you see multiple ball track the one that is the target(to be caught)
# Hack is to use the ball that has the shortest distance

# issue: when the ball is closer to the robot in the claw 
 the x,y,z becomes noisy. i.e X is usually correct, Y and z are incorrect.  Current idea is to filter out all the ball who are not on ground. i.e if height of ball is > MAX_HEIGHT then ignore the ball.
