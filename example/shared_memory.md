In the above files, I am using object detection in a different process, but instead I want to run in a different terminal using multiprocessing.shared_memory . Write code to effectively transfer the color image data from tag_complete's process to the object detection.  Use concepts in Shared Memory, and make sure to add code to do sanity checking for images not being empty, and other things.  I am using For Python 3.8 so I should be able to use  shared memory for IPC. multiprocessing.shared_memory provides a way to share data between Python processes. This method is efficient for sharing large data like images.


To implement inter-process communication (IPC) between your `tag_complete` and `object_detection` processes using `multiprocessing.shared_memory` in Python 3.8, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create Shared Memory in the Parent Process**: You need to create a shared memory block large enough to store your image data. The size depends on the resolution and color depth of your images.

2. **Pass the Shared Memory Information to Both Processes**: Both processes need to know the name of the shared memory block to access it.

3. **Write and Read from the Shared Memory**: In your `tag_complete` process, write the image data to the shared memory. In the `object_detection` process, read the image data from the shared memory.

4. **Synchronization**: Use synchronization primitives like `multiprocessing.Event` to coordinate the writing and reading of the shared memory to avoid race conditions.

5. **Sanity Checks**: Implement checks to ensure the image data is valid and not empty before processing.

Here's an example of how you might structure the code:

### tag_complete.py (Main Process)

```python
import numpy as np
import multiprocessing
import pyrealsense2 as rs
from multiprocessing import shared_memory

def capture_frame():
    # Capture frame from camera (example code)
    pipeline = rs.pipeline()
    config = rs.config()
    config.enable_stream(rs.stream.color, 640, 480, rs.format.bgr8, 30)
    pipeline.start(config)
    frames = pipeline.wait_for_frames()
    color_frame = frames.get_color_frame()
    image = np.asanyarray(color_frame.get_data())
    return image

def main():
    image = capture_frame()
    image_shape = image.shape
    image_size = image.nbytes

    # Create shared memory
    shared_mem = shared_memory.SharedMemory(create=True, size=image_size)
    image_shared = np.ndarray(image_shape, dtype=image.dtype, buffer=shared_mem.buf)
    image_shared[:] = image[:]

    # Create an event for synchronization
    ready_to_read = multiprocessing.Event()

    # Start object detection process
    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=object_detection_process, args=(shared_mem.name, image_shape, ready_to_read))
    process.start()

    # Signal that the image is ready
    ready_to_read.set()

    # Wait for object detection process to finish
    process.join()

    # Clean up
    shared_mem.close()
    shared_mem.unlink()

def object_detection_process(shared_mem_name, image_shape, ready_to_read):
    # This function will be defined in object_detection.py
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### object_detection.py

```python
import numpy as np
from multiprocessing import shared_memory

def object_detection_process(shared_mem_name, image_shape, ready_to_read):
    # Wait for the signal that the image is ready
    ready_to_read.wait()

    # Access the shared memory
    shared_mem = shared_memory.SharedMemory(name=shared_mem_name)
    image_shared = np.ndarray(image_shape, dtype=np.uint8, buffer=shared_mem.buf)

    # Sanity check
    if image_shared.size == 0 or np.any(image_shared == 0):
        print("Received empty or invalid image")
        return

    # Process the image (object detection logic here)
    # ...

    # Clean up
    shared_mem.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # This script would be run as a separate process
    pass
```

In this setup, `tag_complete.py` captures an image from the camera, writes it to shared memory, and then starts the `object_detection_process`. The `object_detection.py` script reads the image from shared memory and processes it.

Remember to match the data types and shapes accurately between the processes and ensure that the size of the shared memory block is sufficient for the image data. The synchronization using `multiprocessing.Event` ensures that the object detection process does not read the shared memory before the main process has finished writing the image data to it.
